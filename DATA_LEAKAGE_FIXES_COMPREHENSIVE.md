# Comprehensive Data Leakage Fixes - Regime Detection Features

## Executive Summary

Successfully identified and resolved **4 major categories** of data leakage in the regime detection feature engineering pipeline. All fixes maintain temporal integrity while preserving the sophisticated regime detection capabilities.

## Critical Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Peak/Trough Detection (MAJOR LEAK) ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Original implementation used `find_peaks()` on entire time series, causing each "peak" to depend on all future data points.

**Before**:
```python
# Used entire series at once - major data leakage
peaks, _ = find_peaks(series.values, distance=max(2, window//2))
```

**After**:
```python
# Causal rolling peak detection using only historical data
for i in range(window, len(df)):
    historical_data = df[feature].iloc[i-lookback_window:i+1].dropna()
    # Peak detection using only past + current, no future data
    recent_max = np.max(values[:-1])  # Max excluding current
    peak_threshold = recent_min + 0.9 * recent_range
    if current_val >= peak_threshold and current_val > values[-2]:
        peak_indicator[i] = 1
```

**Impact**: Eliminated forward-looking bias in all peak/trough identification.

### 2. K-Means Clustering (MAJOR LEAK) ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Used `fit_predict()` on sliding windows that included current period, allowing future patterns to influence current regime classification.

**Before**:
```python
# Current period included in both training and prediction
subset = regime_features.iloc[max(0, i-window*2):i+1]
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(subset.fillna(0))
regime_labels.append(labels[-1])  # Current regime influenced by future
```

**After**:
```python
# Train on historical data only, predict current period separately
historical_data = regime_features.iloc[max(0, i-window*3):i].fillna(0)  # Past only
current_features = regime_features.iloc[i:i+1].fillna(0)  # Current period

kmeans.fit(historical_data)  # Train on past data only
current_regime = kmeans.predict(current_features)[0]  # Predict current
```

**Impact**: Ensured regime classification uses only historical patterns for current period prediction.

### 3. Cycle Analysis Dependencies (MODERATE LEAK) ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Cycle length and position calculations inherited forward bias from original peak detection.

**Before**:
```python
# Used all peaks including future ones
recent_peaks = peak_positions[peak_positions <= i]
```

**After**:
```python
# Use only past peaks for cycle analysis
past_peaks = peak_positions[peak_positions < i]  # Exclude current period
```

**Impact**: All cycle-based features now use only historical peak information.

### 4. Seasonal Correlation Calculations (MINOR LEAK) ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Rolling correlations included current period in both sides of calculation.

**Before**:
```python
# Current period included in both correlation sides
seasonal_corr = df[feature].rolling(window=window*2).corr(df[feature].shift(seasonal_lag))
```

**After**:
```python
# Use only past data for both sides of correlation
past_current = df[feature].shift(1)  # Previous period values
past_seasonal = df[feature].shift(seasonal_lag + 1)  # Past seasonal values
seasonal_corr = past_current.rolling(window=window*2).corr(past_seasonal)
```

**Impact**: Eliminated subtle forward bias in seasonal pattern detection.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Causal Peak Detection Algorithm
```python
def causal_peak_detection(data, window, i):
    """Only uses data up to time i for peak detection at time i"""
    lookback_window = min(window, i)
    historical_data = data.iloc[i-lookback_window:i+1]
    
    current_val = historical_data.iloc[-1]
    recent_max = np.max(historical_data.iloc[:-1])  # Exclude current
    recent_range = recent_max - recent_min
    
    # Peak threshold based on historical distribution only
    peak_threshold = recent_min + 0.9 * recent_range
    return current_val >= peak_threshold and current_val > historical_data.iloc[-2]
```

### Expanding Window Regime Classification
```python
def causal_regime_classification(regime_features, window, i):
    """Train on historical data, predict current regime"""
    if i < window*2:
        return np.nan
        
    # Historical training data (past only)
    historical_data = regime_features.iloc[max(0, i-window*3):i]
    current_features = regime_features.iloc[i:i+1]
    
    # Train clustering model on historical patterns
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(historical_data)
    
    # Predict current regime using historical model
    return kmeans.predict(current_features)[0]
```
